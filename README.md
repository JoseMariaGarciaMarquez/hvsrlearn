## Overview

"hvsrlearn" is a Python application designed for the calculation and analysis of the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) from seismic data in three components (Z, N, E). The application features a graphical user interface built using Tkinter, providing an intuitive and interactive platform for users to analyze and visualize seismic data.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application offers an intuitive graphical interface with organized controls for easy interaction.

- **Real-time Results Visualization:** Users can visualize the HVSR spectrum and relevant parameters in real-time as they adjust settings, enhancing the analysis process.

- **Customizable Analysis Process:** Users can load seismic data files for Z, N, and E components, and customize parameters such as oversampling, window width, overlap, HVSR method, and more.

- **Results Saving Capability:** The application allows users to save generated results, including graphs and relevant data, for further reference.

- **Compatibility with Various HVSR Calculation Methods:** Users can choose from multiple recognized methods for HVSR spectrum calculation, providing flexibility in the analysis approach.

- **Console Monitoring:** An integrated console displays detailed process and result information, enabling users to monitor the analysis progress closely.

- **File Management:** Functionalities for searching and loading seismic data files enhance accessibility and ease of use.
